The market for labor is of particular importance in the economy because it affects all of us. You are directly influenced by the labor market when you are looking for a job or are employed and earning money. In this chapter, instead of firms acting as suppliers, as we have viewed them so far, firms are the buyers (demanders) of labor. And individuals, like you, are the suppliers of labor. 

The market for labor, then, is composed of suppliers (workers) and demanders (firms). Workers produce goods and services and therefore are known as factors of productionâ€”a term we've met before in Chapter 6. Remember that a factor of production is used in the production of other goods. 

Markets for factors of production are somewhat different from markets for goods and services that we consume because the demand for factors of production is derived from the demand for final goods and services. A firm first makes the decision to produce a good or service and then decides which factors are necessary to produce that good or service. </textarea>
